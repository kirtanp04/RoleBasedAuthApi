# Role-Based Authorization API in .NET Core

This project demonstrates a **Role-Based Authorization** system using **.NET Core Web API**. It manages user authentication and access control by defining Admin and User role and restricting access to certain API endpoints based on these roles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Token-based authentication using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles (e.g., Admin and User) to control which users have access to specific API resources.
- **Secure API Endpoints**: Secure sensitive endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 6.0**
- **Entity Framework Core** for database interaction
- **JWT Bearer Tokens** for secure authentication
- **SQL Server** for the database
- **Swagger** for API documentation
